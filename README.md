In narrowing down the given energy dataset, we decided to focus on energy usage separately in two sectors: residential and commercial. We believe it would be important for the Dept. of Energy to examine past trends in energy sources in these sectors to give their recommendations on future policies. Therefore, we generated our two tasks to enable the department to do just that.
##### Task 1: How does the usage of the different energy sources by the residential sector change over time?
- _Why_ is a task pursued?
  - To support Dept of Energy’s recommendations for residential energy policies 
- _How_ is a task conducted?
  - Look at the makeup of residential energy sources over time and compare this with the ideal source makeup
- _What_ does a task seek to learn about the data?
  - Which energy sources are being used the most (and the least) in the residential sector currently, and how these sources have changed from the past
- _Where_ does the task operate?
  - Residential consumption of coal, distillate fuel oil, geothermal, kerosene, petroleum, natural gas, and wood (across all states and years)
- _When_ is the task performed?
  - During presentation to DoE, when DoE finalizes recommendations, and when DoE presents to policymakers
- _Who_ is executing the task? 
  - DoE and policymakers who form residential energy policies

##### Task 2: How does the usage of the different energy sources by the commercial sector change over time?
- _Why_ is a task pursued?
  - To support Dept of Energy’s recommendations for commercial energy policies 
- _How_ is a task conducted?
  - Look at the makeup of commercial energy sources over time and compare this with the ideal source makeup
- _What_ does a task seek to learn about the data?
  - Which energy sources are being used the most (and the least) in the commercial sector currently, and how these sources have changed from the past
- _Where_ does the task operate?
  - Commercial consumption of coal, distillate fuel oil, geothermal, kerosene, petroleum, natural gas, and wood (across all states and years)
- _When_ is the task performed?
  - During presentation to DoE, when DoE finalizes recommendations, and when DoE presents to policymakers
- _Who_ is executing the task? 
  - DoE and policymakers who form commercial energy policies
